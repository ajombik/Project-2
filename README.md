# Project 2D Final Draft
If protein sequence NR2F6 is very similar between humans and mice, then mice that have SNP rs11856995 might show Photic Sneeze Reflex (PSR) phenotype.
To run the code, you will need three .fasta files:
1 - Human NR2F6 protein sequence that was downloaded from NCBI website - the file is called homo.fasta
2 - Mouse NR2F6 protein sequence that was downloaded from NCBI website - the file is called mus.fasta
3 - The best global pairwise alignment of human and mouse NR2F6 protein - the file is called New.fasta
4 - Please, refer to the file titled "Project 2D Notebook Final Draft.ipynb" for the updated version of the Jypiter Notebook
